# In order for a text file to be parsed, call database.read(<filename>).
# In order for the text file to be parsed it must ALSO follow this specific structure,
#   which I will explain through the course of this test file.
# The parser splits the lines by spaces, so any names with spaces must be replaced with underscores.
# '#' Denotes comments, which will be ignored by the parser.

# '>' Denotes a faculty line, which must be structured '<Name> <ID>' as shown below.

# Indenting isn't required, but I think it makes the document look nicer :)
# The parser also ignores blank lines so you can fill the doc with however many you like!
# Any non-blank line that is not preceded by a recognizable symbol will be skipped over and
#   reported in the console.
# Below is an example of what an uncommented structure for a Faculty would look like:
